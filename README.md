LUCAS was the project I worked on for much of my first co-op at NthCycle, a metal refining startup. As the sole software engineer, this project and associated infrastructure was wholly authored by me. 

 - ```history.txt``` and ```improvements.txt``` are files I wrote on my last day for any future software engineer who might come across this code, partially sourced from compiling other notes I left for myself on my desktop. They have been slightly modified for public use.
 - ```reflections.txt``` was written by me three months after my employment ended as I began my next co-op search.

I have consent of the company to have screenshots of LUCAS posted publicly and to give live demos to employers under the condition that none of the company's processes or data are revealed. To avoid this, I have populated the demo database to replicate how a fictional bread manufacturer might use the application. 

The color scheme is made to match the company colors. The name LUCAS is in accordance with the "Stranger Things" company naming scheme, with a backronym of Lab Uploads Centralized And Searchable.

Here are some screenshots/gifs of the application:
